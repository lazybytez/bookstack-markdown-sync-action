## Description
This action allows to synchronize one or more Markdown files to BookStack.
This makes it possible to maintain documentation within a repository while still
making it available in your central documentation solution.

This action features:
- Sync to either a chapter or a book
- Use either a single file or a glob pattern to sync multiple files
- Keep your pages up to date - the action can create and update pages

## Limitations
- To support globs and therefore the creation of multiple pages at once, this action uses the **first** headline of type **# (h1)** as the name for the pages
- Your Markdown files **must** have at least one **#** to be accepted by the Action
- The sync is currently one way, so deleting files from the repository won't delete the pages from BookStack
- We always push an update to BookStack which generates additional traffic, however, BookStack won't create additional revisions if the content is unchanged
- You must grab the book/chapter ID from the database or using the API to configure the action

## Inputs

### `url`
- **Required**
- The URL to your BookStack instance, where the files will be synced to.

### `token-id`
- **Required**
- The ID of your BookStack API connection.

### `token-secret`
- **Required**
- The secret of your BookStack API connection.

### `book-id`
- **Required, when `chapter-id` is not set**
- The ID of the book to sync to.

### `chapter-id`
- **Required, when `book-id` is not set**
- The ID of the book to sync to.

### `path`
- The path to the Markdown file(s) to sync, you can use glob patterns for multiple files

## Outputs
This action does not output anything, if everything goes well.

## Example usage

```yaml
uses: lazybytez/sync-markdown-bookstack-action@1.0.0
with:
    bookstack-url: 'https://bookstack.your.url'
    bookstack-token-id: '{{ secrets.BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_ID }}'
    bookstack-token-secret: '{{ secrets.BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_SECRET }}'
    # You only need one of book-id or chapter-id
    book-id: 123
    chapter-id: 123
    # You can either use a path to a file or a glob pattern:
    path: 'sub/directories/README.md'
    path: 'sub/*/*.md'
```
